CakePop!
========
CakePop is a set of CoffeeScript Cake extensions. It provides various helper
wrappers for bash shell commands and other Node.js binary process executions.

See CakePop's own `Cakefile` for example usage.

Documentation is presently in source comments in `cakepop.coffee`. While not
ideal, the source is quite readable. There will be a more friendly version in
the future.

Roadmap
=======
* Switch to real object instances for things that take configurations.
  (E.g., coffeescript)
* Switch all callback signatures to (err, results)-form.
* Add documentation.
* Generate to JavaScript.
* Tasks / Helpers:
    * Watch CS and build to JS.
    * JsHint
